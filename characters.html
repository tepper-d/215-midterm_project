        <h2>Characters</h2>
        <p class="body">The chief protagonist of Dragon Age: Origins is the player-controlled character, whose biography and combat specialization are determined by the race and class chosen at the start of the game. While the player can choose his or her avatar's first name, the character is usually referred to as "The Warden" by other characters and the game's narration.</p>

        <p class="body">Many of the game's non-player characters (NPCs) are companion characters, who appear throughout the game and may volunteer their services. Companions include:

          <ul>
            <li><span class="list">Alistair</span>, a reluctantly heroic Grey Warden with a sarcastic wit.</li>
            <li><span class="list">Morrigan</span>, a spiteful apostate mage who has little regard for authority or social mores.</li>
            <li><span class="list">Leliana</span>, a lay sister of the Ferelden Chantry whose optimistic and virtuous demeanor belies an aptitude for espionage and combat.</li>
            <li><span class="list">Sten</span>, a proud but stoic warrior of the deeply regimented Qunari people who often questions the ways of other races.</li>
            <li><span class="list">Oghren</span>, an unkempt dwarven warrior whose love of alcohol is only matched by his penchant for physical violence and loyalty to his friends.</li>
            <li><span class="list">Wynne</span>, a senior member of the Ferelden Circle of Magi, a maternal figure to the party and a powerful healer.</li>
            <li><span class="list">Zevran</span>, a rakish elven assassin who is fond of treasures, sex and innuendo.</li>
            <li><span class="list">Mabari War Hound</span>, which the player can name and use for scouting and combat.</li>
            <li><span class="list">Shale</span>, a sarcastic Golem with a mild ornithophobia who was a female dwarf in her prior life, is also available as an optional companion with the DLC The Stone Prisoner installed.</li>
          </ul>

        </p>

        <p class="body">Outside of companion characters, NPC's significant to the Origins plot include Duncan, the Grey Warden who recruits the player; Arl Eamon Guerrin of Redcliffe, the uncle of Ferelden's naive but courageous King Cailan Theirin; Bann Teagan Guerrin, the brother of Arl Eamon; Queen Anora, Cailan's politically savvy wife, with a commanding personality that is somewhat offset by her ambition and ruthlessness; and Flemeth, Morrigan's mother, who appears to be a harmless old woman, but in truth is an infamous dark witch of Fereldan legend.</p>

        <p class="body">The rampaging Darkspawn horde is led by the Archdemon Urthemiel, supposedly one of the Old Gods of the Tevinter Imperium incarnated in the form of a powerful and corrupted dragon with total control over the Darkspawn. The game's other main antagonists are Loghain Mac Tir, Teyrn of Gwaren and father of Queen Anora, a once-respected war hero gone mad with ambition and paranoia; and Rendon Howe, the amoral and corrupt Arl of Amaranthine who allies with Loghain to further his own ambitions.</p>
